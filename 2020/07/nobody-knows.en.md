<cite>Nobody Knows</cite>[^1]
=============================

I watched Hirokazu Kore-eda's <cite>Nobody Knows</cite>
(<cite lang="ja">誰も知らない</cite>) with Lisa, and I had to
choke back tears several times.  To put it bluntly, it was a *total disaster*
and a *systemic tragedy*.

Artificial structures have [redundancies], so even if one or two parts fail,
it usually doesn't disrupt what the whole structure is trying to accomplish.
Therefore, if a structure malfunctions significantly, it can be said that there
are already many layers of failure.  Watching the first half of the film,
I thought that the tragedy that befell this family had to be the result of
more than just one or two things going wrong, it had to be the cumulative effect
of many things going wrong on a larger level -- hence the *total disaster*.
But by the end of the film, this idea was turned inside out.
The tragic loss of life in one or two of these families does not interfere with
the benefit (functioning) of the social system for most of *us*, and therefore
<q><cite>Nobody Knows</cite></q> about their deaths -- that is, they are
*systemic tragedies*, and they *function* as redundancies in the system for
the rest of us to enjoy our lives...

      use Facebook anymore, so I'm posting it here.
