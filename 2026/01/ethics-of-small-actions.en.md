Why I don't destroy snowmen
===========================

In winter, I sometimes come across stories on X about men who deliberately kick
over snowmen as they walk by. It's not like destroying a snowman causes real
harm to anyone. But there's something visible in that act—a certain ethical
disposition either lacking or being formed.

For the same reason, I don't speak to LLMs dismissively, and I avoid barking
commands at them. I know LLMs don't get hurt or offended by my tone. But what
matters isn't the LLM's response—it's what kind of person I'm becoming. Think
about someone who throws and hits stuffed animals. The stuffed animal doesn't
feel pain, but the person doing it repeatedly becomes that kind of person, bit
by bit.

In this vein, I'm uncomfortable with language that evokes slavery when talking
about AI or LLMs. Expressions like “whipping the LLM” get used in tech
communities as a kind of joke, and beneath that lies an attitude that treats
the historical violence of slavery as a lightweight metaphor. Of course LLMs
aren't actually slaves. (Or are they?) But the moment we feel comfortable using
slavery as a casual comparison, we lose our sensitivity to the actual violence
it refers to.

What we do and how we speak ultimately shapes who we are. How we act toward
something that doesn't respond, when no one is watching, might reveal us more
purely than anything else. Whether it's snowmen, LLMs, or the language we
use—all of it shapes us.

That's why I don't destroy snowmen. I use respectful language with LLMs. I
don't turn slavery into material for jokes. I believe these small choices make
me who I am.
