Ghost funds Fedify
==================

I am happy to announce some great news!  [Fedify], an open source project
I've been working on since this spring, has been funded by [Ghost],
a global publishing platform.

[Ghost]: https://ghost.org/


What is Fedify?
---------------

First, let me explain what Fedify is.

<dfn>[Fedify]</dfn> is an [ActivityPub] server framework.
<dfn>[ActivityPub]</dfn> protocol is behind the technology that allows
disparate social media services like the Mastodon, an open source project,
and Threads from Meta to come together and communicate.  This federation of
social media is called the <dfn>[fediverse]</dfn>.

ActivityPub may seem like a simple protocol at first glance,
but it's actually quite complicated to implement interoperability
with other services.  I was looking for a framework that would take care of
those tricky parts for me, and since none existed, I created one.

Ghost's adoption of Fedify
--------------------------

Until a couple of months ago, Fedify was more of a toy for people's hobby
projects, but it still had a small community of users, and one day someone
told me about [Ghost's adoption of ActivityPub][1] and suggested that I should
try to sell Fedify to the Ghost team, since Ghost is also written in TypeScript.
I was hesitant at first, wondering if it would work, but when I heard that
the person who encouraged me to sell to Ghost had sent an email directly to
the Ghost team, I got the confidence to contact them.

I was surprised to find out that the Ghost team was [reviewing Fedify
in a positive way][2], and they told me that they had indeed [decided to go
ahead with Fedify]. It was a surprise, and I was thrilled!

Funding
-------

After that, I stayed in close contact with the Ghost team, especially the team
building ActivityPub into Ghost, and it wasn't long before they approached me
with an offer to fund the Fedify project and implement the features they wanted
to see added to Fedify.  I was in the middle of a job hunt and was sending my
résumé to various companies, so this was quite a tempting offer.

I agreed to work with them for about a couple of weeks and got a little funding.
I was able to work on Fedify while preparing for my job search, and I found it
to be very immersive and enjoyable.  Eventually, I expressed my interest in
working on Fedify full-time if I could be funded for a longer period of time,
and the Ghost team responded positively.

So I've been able to continue working on Fedify with funding for quite some
time now.  I once worked on an open source project full-time at my previous job,
but this is the first time I've ever worked on an open source project I started
in a funded way, and I'm excited about the future.
